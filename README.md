#Welcome to WeatherBuddy!
Our app gives you the current weather for all of your favorite cities. Tap on a city to see more details, like the forecast for the next few days, or the high and low temperatures for the day. You can also see all of your favorite cities' weather displayed on a map to get a better view of the current weather across the country. Tap on the contacts tab to see what your contacts' weather is like. Only your contacts that you have an address listed for will be shown. You can also adjust the settings in the app. You can choose from Classic, Notre Dame, and Dog themes, and switch from Fahrenheit, to Celsius, to Kelvin for the units of temperature.

#Notes:
* After adding a city, the user may pull to refresh in order to load the new weather data and load the city onto the map.
* When viewing contacts' weather the contacts' 5-digit zipcodes must be included in their address information for their city's weather to appear in the Contacts tab.
* This app is optimized and designed for use with cities in the continental United States. (It will not work for locations outside the US)
* Cities and Settings will persist when the app is quit, not when the simulation is stopped.
